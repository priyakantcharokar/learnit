Dear Team,

Surgery happened for left eye and right eye on 9th June & 16th June respectively.

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a slight delay in submitting the necessary medical proofs and documents for my mother-in-law's recent eye surgery. Please accept my apologies for any inconvenience caused.

The reason behind this delay is that the hospital where the surgery took place is located in Mumbai, and the responsible doctor is currently out of the country until July 5th. Despite this situation, I assure you that I am actively working on collecting all the required documentation and will submit it as soon as the doctor becomes available.

Thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter. 

Warm regards,
Priyakant Charokar
